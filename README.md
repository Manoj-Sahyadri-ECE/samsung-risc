## What is RISC-V?
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC). Unlike proprietary architectures, RISC-V is free and open, enabling anyone to design, implement, and customize processors without licensing fees or royalties. <br>

## Key Features of RISC-V:
* **Modularity**: RISC-V supports a base integer instruction set, with optional extensions like floating-point, vector processing, and more. <br>
* **Simplicity**: Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from microcontrollers to supercomputers.
* **Scalability**: RISC-V is versatile, supporting implementations for embedded systems, mobile devices, cloud computing, and beyond. <br>
* **Open and Extensible**: Developers can create custom extensions while remaining compatible with the standard ISA. <br>

RISC-V has rapidly gained popularity in academia, industry, and open-source communities, driving innovation in hardware design and accelerating the development of new computing solutions. <br>

This Github repository will be consisting of the tasks and projects which I will be doing throughout this Internship Program.

## Task 1

This task was regarding the setting up of UBUNTU environment for the RISCV project. <br>
In Task 1, a basic C program file was created and compiled using GCC compiler. Various outputs were observed by changing the variable values. <br>
The riscv64 rv32i compiler was introduced for the same, to generate the object file, using O1 optimization.


## Task 2

In this task, a simple C program was written, and the program was compiled and .out file was executed the check the instruction sets by using spike command. <br>
The same task was done by compiling the file with riscv64 rv32i architecture, and the instruction sets were observed by using spike command.

The same file was compiled in riscv architecture, using riscv64 command, and the instruction sets were observed using 'O1' and 'Ofast' Optimizations. <br>
The instruction counts were observed. <br>


## Task 3

In this task, Different type of Instruction sets were observed. R-type (register-register operations), I-type (register-immediate operations), S-type (store
instructions), B-type (branch instructions), U-type (load upper immediate), and J-type (jump instructions) were observed. Set of 15 instructions were 
decoded and the type was determined.

## Task 4

In this task, Waveform file was obtained for the given verilog code, for the set of different instructions. The output was obtained by observing each and every 
register operation. The waveform files for particular operations were obtained.
